# Encryption Algorithm Choice

## Context

Selection of an encryption algorithm for deterministic pseudonymization of PII data (NHS numbers, postcodes, names,
DOB). Deterministic behavior allows joins across datasets because the same input always produces the same ciphertext.


## Requirements:

- Secure, standards-based algorithm
- Deterministic encryption
- High performance
- Operational maintainability and future-proofing

## Candidate Algorithms:

- AES-SIV (RFC 5297) - Two-pass, no nonce needed
- AES-GCM-SIV (RFC 8452) - Single-pass, nonce required but misuse-resistant

### AES-SIV (Synthetic IV) - How it Works

Two-Pass Construction:

```
Pass 1: SIV = CMAC(Key1, Data || Associated_Data)  → Generate IV
Pass 2: Ciphertext = AES-CTR(Key2, Data, IV=SIV)   → Encrypt data
```

In simple terms:

1. Create a fingerprint: Takes your data and creates a unique "fingerprint" (CMAC) that identifies it
2. Use fingerprint as lock code: This fingerprint becomes the lock combination for encrypting
3. Encrypt the data: Uses standard AES encryption with the fingerprint as the key
4. Package together: Combines the fingerprint and encrypted data into one result

- Same data always gets same fingerprint -> same encrypted result
- No need to generate nonces
- If someone tampers with the data, the fingerprint won't match (tamper detection)

### AES-GCM-SIV (Galois/Counter Mode with SIV) - How it Works

Single-Pass with Nonce:

```
Key_Auth, Key_Enc = Derive_Keys(Key, Nonce)
Tag = POLYVAL(Key_Auth, Data || Associated_Data || Lengths)
IV = AES(Key_Enc, Tag ⊕ Nonce)
Ciphertext = AES-CTR(Key_Enc, Data, IV)
```

In simple terms:

1. Split the key: Takes your main key and splits it into two specialized keys (one for checking, one for encrypting)
2. Create a checksum: Makes a mathematical summary (POLYVAL) of the data for verification
3. Mix with deterministic nonce: Combines the checksum with a deterministic nonce (derived from the data) to create
   encryption settings
4. Encrypt in one go: Encrypts everything in a single, fast operation


- Slower than AES-SIV (42% slower in our tests)
- Still deterministic when using deterministic nonce derivation
- Built-in tamper detection like AES-SIV
- Single-pass construction but with performance cost

## Test Results:

Both algorithms passed all security tests:

- 100% deterministic encryption (100k NHS numbers)
- 100% tamper detection (10 test samples)
- Zero collisions in 1,000 unique NHS pseudonyms
- Cross-dataset joinability: 100% successful joins on NHS pseudonyms

Scalability Performance (1K to 1M records × 5 fields each):

Performance testing includes realistic operational overhead: nonce generation (for AES-GCM-SIV), associated data
creation, and field-specific metadata handling. These measurements reflect actual implementation costs, not isolated
encryption operations.

AES-SIV Results:

- Medium scale (100,000 records): 234,971 ops/sec
- Large scale (1,000,000 records): 231,276 ops/sec
- Excellent consistency: 231K-235K ops/sec across all scales
- CPU efficiency: Lower CPU usage (96.8% vs 95.6% at 1M records)

AES-GCM-SIV Results:

- Small scale (1,000 records): 159,071 ops/sec
- Medium scale (100,000 records): 160,075 ops/sec
- Large scale (1,000,000 records): 163,206 ops/sec
- Stable but lower: 159K-163K ops/sec range
- Higher CPU utilization across scales

Performance Analysis:

- AES-SIV consistently outperforms AES-GCM-SIV by approximately 42%
- AES-SIV maintains exceptional stability (231K-235K ops/sec) across 1K to 1M record scales
- AES-GCM-SIV shows consistent but significantly lower performance (159K-163K ops/sec)
- Both algorithms demonstrate linear scalability with predictable resource usage

Pure Encryption Performance (100K records × 5 fields, isolated cipher.encrypt() operations):
When measuring only cipher.encrypt() calls without operational overhead, AES-GCM-SIV demonstrates its theoretical
single-pass advantage over AES-SIV's two-pass construction.

- AES-SIV: 214418.05 encryptions/sec
- AES-GCM-SIV: 415872.03 encryptions/sec

## Architecture Considerations:

### AES-SIV (RFC 5297)

- Pros: 42% better performance, no nonce management, simpler implementation, wider library support
- Cons: Two-pass construction (but still faster in practice)
- Best for: Maximum implementation simplicity, high performance, broad compatibility

### AES-GCM-SIV (RFC 8452)

- Pros: Single-pass efficiency, nonce misuse resistance
- Cons: 42% slower performance, requires nonce generation strategy
- Best for: Scenarios where single-pass construction is specifically required

## Future-Proofing & Migration Strategy

Algorithm Migration Capability:
Both algorithms support smooth migration to new cryptographic methods through associated data metadata:

Current Implementation:

```python
associated_data = [b"aes-siv", b"key-v1", b"nhs_number"]
# Algorithm identifier allows version tracking and migration
```

Migration Strategy:

1. New implemenatation of new algorithm (e.g., AES-GCM-SIV)

2. Gradual Transition: New data encrypted with new algorithm while maintaining old algorithm for historical data
3. Cross-Algorithm Compatibility: Two-layer strategy (will be covered in key rotation analysis) enables algorithm
   changes without breaking joins
4. Background Re-encryption: Historical data can be migrated in background processes without downtime

Migration Impact:

- Minimal Downtime: New algorithm deployed alongside existing one
- Preserved Joins: Master hash IDs remain algorithm-independent
- Audit Trail: Associated data tracks which algorithm encrypted each record

## Resilience & Resource Requirements

Performance Under Load (Verified from 1K to 1M records):

- AES-SIV: 231,276 ops/sec at 1M scale, exceptional consistency
- AES-GCM-SIV: 163,206 ops/sec at 1M scale, stable but lower
- Scalability Testing: Verified with volumes from 1K to 1M records

Resource Consumption Characteristics:

- Linear Scaling: Performance scales predictably with data volume (verified across 8 test volumes)
- Memory Efficient: Both algorithms process data in streaming fashion with minimal memory growth
- CPU Predictable: Stable CPU usage patterns, no unexpected spikes during high-volume processing
- Failure Resilience: Graceful degradation under resource constraints

Scalability Test Results:
Comprehensive scalability testing demonstrates:

- Predictable scaling: Time and memory growth proportional to data volume
- Resource efficiency: Both algorithms handle 1M+ records efficiently
- Performance consistency: AES-SIV maintains 42% performance advantage at all scales

## Implementation Notes:

Critical for Cross-Source Consistency:

- Associated Data Strategy: Use standardized associated data across all systems to ensure deterministic matching:
    - Algorithm identifier: `b"aes-gcm-siv"` or `b"aes-siv"`
    - Key version: `b"key-v1"` or `b"key-v2"`
    - Field type: `b"nhs_number"`, `b"postcode"`, `b"name"`, etc.
    - Example: `[b"aes-gcm-siv", b"key-v1", b"nhs_number"]`

For AES-GCM-SIV Deterministic Cross-Source Matching:

- Nonce Strategy: Derive nonce from data itself (not random/counter)
- Implementation example: `nonce = SHA256(nhs_number + field_type + key_version)[:12]`
- Critical: All systems must use identical nonce derivation logic

For AES-SIV:

- Associated Data: Must be identical across all systems
- No special nonce considerations - naturally deterministic

Both Algorithms:

- Implement key rotation with version tracking in associated data
- Use consistent field type identifiers across all pipeline components
- Document and enforce associated data standards organization-wide

## Recommendation:

AES-SIV is recommended for LDP workloads based on 42% performance advantage while maintaining equivalent
security.

Key benefits verified through testing:

- Significant performance gain (231K vs 163K ops/sec)
- 42% faster when processing realistic PII data workloads (5 fields per patient)
- Lower processing costs in serverless environments
- Exceptional performance consistency across 1K to 1M record scales
- Simpler implementation without nonce management complexity
- Proven security with built-in tamper detection
- Supported in Python cryptography ecosystem

Alternative: AES-GCM-SIV remains viable if single-pass construction is specifically required, though at significant
performance cost.
